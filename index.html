						<p>
							One thing I enjoy most about programming is that it forces you to learn from a new perspective, constantly. It requires careful consideration of not only what you make, but how it will be used. And, that's an important feeling. Programming's zen comes in how humble it forces someone to be in order to progress at it. Sometimes, it's like being in a foreign world, where nothing makes sense. Perception is referential, but when you look at something truly, <em>new</em> you have no references. You must now build some understanding of what you're looking at from the ground up.
						</p>

							Aside from pontificating on weird things, I enjoy getting outdoors and enjoying the nature that our state has to offer. I've been skydiving, although I have a persistent fear of heights (And yes, I was sick for quite some time, afterward). I'd love to get back into mountain biking, and that's my planned future endeavor for when I have the time and income. If you're ever interested in talking about programming or any number of topics, please feel free to send me a message through the contact page.
